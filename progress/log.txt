10.3: 
Built the project. Took the ScalaFX app down to the bones, as I don't need much functionality from it.
At the moment it is running scene, but a migration to canvas is a possibility as it draws everything over each time.
In either case, remaining problem is figuring out how to control refreshing. Also in the app I built a coordinate converter and 
a triangle drawer (decided to build the engine around triangles for better future support of varying objects).
    CSVReader reads the data, for which I created an Excel doc with formulas, which handle longitudal, and latitudal corridors,
for easy replication.
    Exceptions to handle e.g. wrongly formatted data.
    Matrix Calculations for 3x3 and 3x1. Tested.
    Projection, to which I've pin-pointed the current drawing problem. The output is complete non-sense, and
a possible fault is that the y and z- axis are wrong way around as the formula had no definition for those.
So the fault is in my opinion in the Projector-object.
    Camera, which holds rotation and position, and methods to change those. Should work, as the Projection takes out the
camera coordinates, and sets camera to origo, so it's surprisingly simple.
